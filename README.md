# Tetris Like

A "[Tetris](https://tetris.com)" as a demonstration of video game development with [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) in a cross-platform project using the FireMonkey framework.

This program was developed during a [live stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) on April 11 and 18, 2021. It is available as an educational resource and should not be distributed outside of [this link](https://tetrislike.gamolf.fr/).

If you want to play or learn about [the real Tetris](https://tetris.com), go to [the official game site](https://tetris.com).

If you don't have Delphi ([Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter), [Academic](https://www.embarcadero.com/development-tools-for-education) or [for professionals](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi)) to compile this project but want to play with it, download [its latest release](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/TetrisLike/releases).

To see how this version of the [Tetris video game](https://tetris.com) was developed, watch [the replay of its coding sessions](https://serialstreameur.fr/jv-tetris-like.php) on [the Serial Streamer site](https://serialstreameur.fr/).

You don't know Delphi or Pascal? You can find all the resources (books, videos, courses, tutorials, blogs, examples) to learn more on these directories:
- [Resources to learn Delphi](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/)
- [Resources to learn the Pascal language](https://pascal-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/)

And if you've never programmed before, give it a try. Pascal is easy to learn and Delphi is just great for doing everything!
